# Project Summary
> "This is a Machine Learning Classification Project on the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)'s one of the best competitions, [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). I have analyzed and visualized the data, and created a Machine Learning model that predicts whether a person will survive or not.

- By doing this project, I've learned a lot about building predictive classification models using Python along with various libraries/modules. I've tried my best to find insights from the raw data and have communicated them in a clear and compelling manner."
